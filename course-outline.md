Using this [Magic 8 Ball API](https://8ball.delegator.com/), make a Magic 8 Ball interface.  Your sketch must adhere to the following constraints:
1. There must be a place where the user can type their question.
2. Use `setTimeout` to introduce the idea of waiting and suspense.  There must be some period of anticipation once the question is asked, like an interesting "loading..." screen or dialog.  
3. Use the `fetch` API and `async/await` functions in your API call and set up a `try/catch` block to catch any errors.
4. Display the response from the API.

You can submit your sketch here (link TBD).
