[Zoom link]('https://nyu.zoom.us/my/billythemusical') unless otherwise arranged

# <h>Course Objectives</h>

Students in this course will:
- Further their knowledge and understanding of p5.js and Javascript
- Understand "vanilla" Javascript and how it operates inside and outside of the web browser
- Understand how to develop code in a local environment and how to include external libraries
- Understand basic server/client architecture and write backend code
- Be equipped to explore and include open source code in their work 

# <h>Decorum</h>

This course is for you to attain more competency of the concepts covered here.  The goal is to have you be able to utilize the many tools that are available online to do what you want to do faster.  Please make the best use of our time in class.  I will also make myself available at various times to assist you outside of class, but like most adjuncts, I work outside of NYU and also have a family to consider.  So please be respectful of my time and I will do the same.

Unless otherwise stated, I adhere to a "laptops down" mentality while I am lecturing or other students are presenting their work.  Feel free to take notes on paper and write down questions to ask when the floor is opened. 

# <h> Attendance Policy </h>  

This is a 7-week course with only 14 class meetings.  As such, if you have more than 2 unexcused absences, I will be forced to drop your grade one letter per additional absence.  

Furthermore, please do not be late to class.  If you arrive more than 10 minutes late to class, this will be counted as an unexcused absence.

# <h>Grading Policy</h>

**Assignments - 70%**

- One assignment will be given for the 7 modules and each worth 10% of your grade.

**Reading/writing - 10%**  

- Reading will occasionally be assigned with a written blog post response. Collectively, these are worth 10% of your grade.

**Class Participation - 20%**  

- Class participation includes taking part in class discussion and exercises, asking questions, and communicating reliably with the professor.  

>*Please note there will be no "Final" project or exam for this class; consistent weekly participation throughout the term is your best course of action.*


# <h>Methodology</h>

The course is broken up into 7 modules, comprised of one to three classes per module.  Depending on the needs of the class, there will be some flexibility in the number of classes spent on each and where the assignments will land.  Typically, the first class of the module will be presented in a tutorial format with the instructor demonstrating and explaining some aspect of computer programming. The latter module classes will blend tutorial with various exercises like short in-class coding assignments, partner programming, and sharing student work.

In the interest of keeping a lively and discourse, students are encouraged to note any questions they may have and to be ready to ask them when prompted.  If they wish, they may raise their hand for attention, but please refrain from interrupting the instructor unless necessary.

# <h>Procedures should punch up...</h>

Read Leonard Richardson's Bots should punch up. "You can poke fun at yourself (Stephen Colbert famously said 'There's no status I would not surrender for a joke'), you can make a joke at the expense of someone with higher social status than you, but if you mock someone with lower status, it's not cool." Be sensitive to what your classmates might find offensive, triggering, or violent; be graceful and listen carefully when your work gets called out.

# <h>Pre-Requisites</h>

Generally, Creative Coding is a requirement to take this class. Certain exceptions can be made if a student can demonstrate proficiency or for other certain circumstances.

# <h>Assignments</h>


>*"Every homework assignment is an opportunity for genius."*
>
> Zach Leiberman, computational artist and educator

While the above quote may fill you with as much anxiety as excitement, think of these assignments as an invitation to bring forth your creative spirit.  They are designed to display your understanding of the material and can hopefully be work that you refer back to as you progress as a programmer.  

- In addition to reading and research posts, you are responsible for **7 weekly assignments**, typically given at the end of each module and **due before the next class**.  

- Assignments and are meant to take anywhere from 2 - 6 hours to complete and as such will usually be assigned over a weekend.  Not only will you be presenting your code, but also your process through documentation - what inspired you, what resources you used, what mistakes you made along the way, any solutions that you found, etc.

- Turn in your assignments on [this Google form](https://forms.gle/HDGNGaoMaxBRPr2e9).

Specific requirements for assignments:

- Each assignment should be accompanied by a blog post that provides documentation of your process in fulfilling the assignment's objectives.  

- You'll need somewhere to upload your completed sketches.  At times, we will use the p5 web editor for this.  For later assignments, you may already have your own web hosting service, like [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).  If not, I'll show you how to set a [Neocities](https://neocities.org/) account in class.  

- Assignments must be turned in *before class* on the day they're due. Late assignments will not be accepted.  

- Assignments will be graded on their technical mastery and creativity. Occasionally, and as time permits, we'll be critiquing student work in-class, generally in an informal way and on a volunteer basis.

**STATEMENT OF ACADEMIC INTEGRITY**  

Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s work as though it were your own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own: A sequence of words quoted without quotation marks from another writer or a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work or facts, ideas or images composed by someone else.  More information can be found on Tisch’s page regarding Academic Integrity (http://tisch.nyu.edu/faculty/academic-integ).

**ACCESSIBILITY** 

Academic accommodations are available for students with documented disabilities. Please contact the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities at 212 998-4980 for further information.

Here is also a great reference text from the creators of p5.js and Processing, respectively:

- [Make: Getting Started with p5.js: Making Interactive Graphics in JavaScript and Processing](http://www.amazon.com/Make-Interactive-Graphics-JavaScript-Processing/dp/1457186772/), by Lauren McCarthy, Ben Fry, and Casey Reas

### On The Web  

What's great about *Code as a Creative Medium* and *Generative Design* is that they have online components with code examples that you can explore:
- [link to code as a creative medium github](https://github.com/CodeAsCreativeMedium)
- [link to generative design website](https://github.com/jediahkatz/generative-design)

Here are a number of handy resources we will be using throughout the class:  

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
- [W3 Schools Javascript Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/default.asp)
- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/javascript)
- [Open Processing](openprocessing.org)
- [Creative Coding Courses](https://github.com/terkelg/awesome-creative-coding)

I know some others of you have also expressed interest in learning other languages.  I can certainly vouch for [this Google tutorial](https://developers.google.com/edu/python) on learning Python.
