# <h>Syllabus</h> 

**NYU Tisch School of The Arts: Interactive Media Arts**

**IMNY-UT 281 002 - Topics in Media Art: Re:Code** 

**Fall, 2022**  

This class meets on:

Tuesdays & Thursdays, 10:40am - 12:20pm  
370 Jay St (Brooklyn Campus), 4th floor, Room 408

Your instructor is:

William "Billy" Bennett  

Email: bennett.billy@nyu.edu

Drop-in hours: Mondays/Fridays 10-11am, 
[Zoom link]('https://nyu.zoom.us/my/billythemusical') unless otherwise arrnaged

# <h>Course Objectives</h>

Students in this course will:
- Further their knowledge and understanding of p5.js and Javascript
- Understand "vanilla" Javascript and how it operates inside and outside of the web browser
- Understand how to develop code in a local environment and how to include external libraries
- Understand basic server/client architecture and write backend code
- Be equipped to explore and include open source code in their work 

# <h>Decorum</h>

This course is for you to attain more competency of the concepts covered here.  The goal is to have you be able to utilize the many tools that are available online to do what you want to do faster.  Please make the best use of our time in class.  I will also make myself available at various times to assist you outside of class, but like most adjuncts, I work outside of NYU and also have a family to consider.  So please be respectful of my time and I will do the same.

Unless otherwise stated, I adhere to a "laptops down" mentality while I am lecturing or other students are presenting their work.  Feel free to take notes on paper and write down questions to ask when the floor is opened. 

# <h> Attendence Policy </h> 

This is a 7-week course with only 14 class meetings.  As such, if you have more than 2 unexcused absences, I will be forced to drop your grade one letter per additional absence.  

Furthermore, please do not be late to class.  If you arrive more than 10 minutes late to class, this will be counted as an unexcused absence.

# <h>Grading Policy</h>




# <h>Methodology</h>

The course is roughly 7 weekly modules, comprised of two classes per module.  

1. The first class of the module will be presented in a tutorial format with the instructor demonstrating and explaining some aspect of computer programming. 

2. The second class will blend tutorial with various exercises like short in-class coding assigments and partner programming. 

Students are encouraged to ask questions as they arise and to not be worried about interrupting the instructor.

# <h>Course Outline</h>

Week 1 - Foundations  
Week 2 - Advanced Javascript Concepts  
Week 3 - Working with the DOM  
Week 4 - Developing Locally     
Week 5 - Working with External Libraries  
Week 6 - Working with Pixels
Week 7 - Working outside the browser 


# <h>Pre-Requisites</h>

Generally, Creative Coding is a requirement to take this class. Certain exceptions can be made if a student can demonstrate proficiency or for other certain circumstances.

*"Every homework assignment is an opportunity for genius."*

While the above quote may fill you with as much anxiety as excitement, think of it as an invitation to bring forth your creative spirit.  They are designed to display your understanding of the material and can hopefully be work that you refer back to as you progress as a programmer.  

- In addition to reading and research posts, you are responsible for **7 weekly assignments**, given at the end of each module, which are **due before the next class**.  There will not be a typical "Final" assignment; each weekly assignment is evenly weighted, so it's important not to fall behind.

- Assignments and are meant to take anywhere from 2 - 6 hours to complete and as such will usually be assigned over a weekend.  Not only will you be presenting your code, but also your process through documentation - what inspired you, what resources you used, what mistakes you made along the way, any solutions that you found, etc.

- Turn in your assignments on [this Google form](https://forms.gle/HDGNGaoMaxBRPr2e9).

Specific requirements for assignments:

- Each assignment should be accompanied by a blog post that provides documentation of your process in fulfilling the assignment's objectives.  

- You'll need somewhere to upload your completed sketches. If you already have your own web hosting service, like [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), then use that! If not, I'll show you how to set up a [Neocities](https://neocities.org/) account in class.  

- Assignments must be turned in *before class* on the day they're due. Late assignments will not be accepted.  

- Assignments will be graded on their technical mastery and creativity. Occasionally, and as time permits, we'll be critiquing student work in-class, generally in an informal way and on a volunteer basis.

### Textbooks  

This class does not have an official textbook, although a number of assignments will come from the following texts which are freely available in digital or physical form at the NYU Library:

- *Code as a Creative Medium* by Golan Levin and Tega Brain
    - ([NYU Library link](https://bobcat.library.nyu.edu/permalink/f/1c17uag/nyu_aleph007956499) or [for purchase](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262542043/))
- *Generative Design: Visualize, Program, and Create with Javascript in p5.js* by Benedikt Gro√ü, Hartmut Bohnacker, Julia Laub, and Claudius Lazzeroni  
    - ([NYU Library link](https://bobcat.library.nyu.edu/permalink/f/1c17uag/nyu_aleph007590222) or [for purchase](https://www.amazon.com/Generative-Design-Visualize-Program-JavaScript/dp/1616897589))

Here is also a great reference text from the creators of p5.js and Processing, respectively:

[Make: Getting Started with p5.js: Making Interactive Graphics in JavaScript and Processing](http://www.amazon.com/Make-Interactive-Graphics-JavaScript-Processing/dp/1457186772/), by Lauren McCarthy, Ben Fry, and Casey Reas  
- [NYU Library link](https://bobcat.library.nyu.edu/permalink/f/1c17uag/nyu_aleph004490802) or [for purchase](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/make-getting-started/9781457186769/) 

### On The Web  

What's great about *Code as a Creative Medium* and *Generative Design* is that they have online components with code examples that you can explore:
- [link to code as a creative medium github]()
- [link to generative design website]()

Here are a number of handy resources we will be using throughout the class:  

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
- [W3 Schools Javascript Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/default.asp)
- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/javascript)
- [Open Processing](openprocessing.org)

I know some others of you have also expressed interest in learning other languages.  I can certainly vouch for [this Google tutorial](https://developers.google.com/edu/python) on learning Python.
